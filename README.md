# Probabilistic Modeling of Inter- and Intra-observer Variability in Medical Image Segmentation
This is the code of the Pionono model for medical image segmentation ( https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Schmidt_Probabilistic_Modeling_of_Inter-_and_Intra-observer_Variability_in_Medical_Image_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf ), accepted for
ICCV 2023. This code is slightly different than the original git repo by Arne at https://github.com/arneschmidt/pionono_segmentation as the backbone segmentation model and the fusion parts are different.
